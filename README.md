## Hand Tracker in Python
This is a simple hand tracking application built using Python and the OpenCV library. The app detects and tracks a user's hand in real-time through a webcam or video stream.

## Installation
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file and extract it.

Navigate to the project folder using the terminal.

Install the required dependencies:
```pip install opencv-python```
```pip install mediapipe```
# How to Use the Hand Tracker
Run the Python script:

```python "hand tracker.py"```
Allow the script to access your webcam (if prompted).

The hand tracking application will start, and you should see the video feed with your hand being tracked.

Position your hand in front of the camera, and the application will draw landmarks around your hand to track its movement.
